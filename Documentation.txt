What is the Project? 
	The project is a simple integration of three important APIs that could professionally help you.
you first check the calender. if you're bored and need to go out. you can check the empty day on your calender and check if there are any upcoming events.
you can also delete or update events. you can create your own personal event. just enter the day, event name and the location.
you can get some photos about the event you'd like to create. You can enter name,date and event. then, we'll bring you some clear photos for this event (e.g marathons).

Pre:
- You need to install appserv, apache or nginx
- You need to create an account on https://console.developers.google.com
- Get the API key and the client ID from authorization
- Create Eventful account
- Get or update the API key
- Get Or Update the API key of Flickr

Used APIS:
- Google Calender
Services: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

- Eventful
Services: GET

- Flicker
Services: SEARCH

How did we integrate the APIS:
	First, google calender. We authorized our google calender not the public one. 
It was good for us to use a jquery "ajax". and for you to know that what we get from the API is something in Json format.
Second, eventful. We give it the date and its responsibility is to find what events happened that day in a specific location.
the location we mentioned is Cairo, Egypt. Eventful you just make an account and they support thier API key.
Third, Flicker. You just enter your name, date and event. it will appear in the calender and 4 photos will appear on the website.
